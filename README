SYNOPSIS
========

The program 'sff2fastq' extracts read information from a SFF file,
produced by the 454 genome sequencer, and outputs the sequences and
quality scores in a FASTQ format.

Below is the help message (via 'sff2fastq -h') describing its usage.

Usage: sff2fastq [options] <sff_file>
        -h                  This help message   
        -v                  Program and version information
        -n                  Output the untrimmed sequence
        -o <fastq_file>     Desired fastq output file. If not specified, 
                            defaults to stdout

INSTALLATION
============

The installation process currently consists of a very simple Makefile.

Just do the following:

git clone git://github.com/indraniel/sff2fastq.git;
cd sff2fastq;
make; # try 'make genome' if at the Genome Center at Washington University

The 'sff2fastq' executable should be in the working directory.
Afterwards, you can move the executable to wherever you wish.

NOTES
=====

This has been successfully compiled on Linux/Ubuntu 8.04 & 9.10
workstations (both 32-bit and 64-bit machines), and on Mac OS X (version
10.5).  Compiling on other types of operating systems and architectures
has not been experimented upon.
